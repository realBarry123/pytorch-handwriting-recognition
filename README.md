# ðŸ¤– pytorch-handwriting-recognition

This is me following a Pytorch MNIST recognition tutorial on [PyLessons](https://pylessons.com/pytorch-introduction)  

---

So far, I have made the following changes to the code copied from the tutorial: 
- Add comments (to the best of my narrow understanding)
- Minor refactoring
- Add bugs

---

It does not work, probably because I introduced bugs into the code
