# ðŸ¤– pytorch-handwriting-recognition

This is me following a Pytorch MNIST handwritten digit recognition tutorial on [PyLessons.com](https://pylessons.com/pytorch-introduction).

---

This code builds a CNN (convolutional neural network) with two convolutional layers and two fully-connected layers. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset for five epochs and can achieve an accuracy of above 98%.

I have made the following changes to the code from the tutorial: 
- Add comments explaining the code from start to finish
- Write docstrings for functions
- Minor refactoring
- A slightly improved display system for the results
