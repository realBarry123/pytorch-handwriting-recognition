# ðŸ¤– pytorch-handwriting-recognition

This is me following a Pytorch MNIST recognition tutorial on [PyLessons](https://pylessons.com/pytorch-introduction)  

---

This code builds a CNN (convolutional neural network) with two convolutional layers and two linear layers. The network is trained for five epochs and can achieve an accuracy of above 98% in correctly indentifying digits.

So far, I have made the following changes to the code from the tutorial: 
- Add comments explaining the code from start to finish
- Minor refactoring`
- A slightly improved display system for the results
